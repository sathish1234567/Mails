Respected Sir/ Madam,

Thank you for sending the offer letter! This is to bring to your kind notice that, while reading my offer letter, I noticed that the salary specified in the offer letter did not match with the salary discussed in my job interview.

I have been getting the same salary in my current job hence I am expecting a raise. So, kindly verify the offer and resolve my query.

Thanking you.

Yours Sincerely, (Your name)
