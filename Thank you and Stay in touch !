Sub:Thank you and Stay in touch !

Dear All,

Time has come to say good bye..!

It is with mixed emotions that I send out this email as I have spent close to 5.5 years in Jio.
I am glad to be a part of this awesome journey and I don’t have enough words to express my gratitude to those who have been kind enough to help me grow as an individual.
It has been a pleasure knowing you all  and do stay  in touch.!

Here are my contact details:

Dear All,

Finally the moment has arrived to say goodbye. It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience where I have enjoyed every movement. Reliance Jio and all of you have given me memories which can never be erased from my heart. The people, the culture everything is just awesome. I am thankful for having this wonderful opportunity to work with you all.
I would like to thank Paresh Pitroda, Dipakkumar Joshi and Raman Patil for guiding me all the time.
Special thanks to Nimish Dave for guiding and making my life easy at Reliance Jio.
Wish you all the very best…do keep in touch…and stay safe.

regards
