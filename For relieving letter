Dear (Sir/ Madam/Name)

This is to request that I am looking forward to receiving my relieving letter. I resigned from the company on (date) and completed all my formalities. I served the notice period of 3 months and my last working day with the company was (date). I have worked with sheer dedication for three years in your organization and I would be very grateful if you do the needful at the earliest.

I would appreciate it if you provide with the letter asap as I need to submit the same in my new organization. I hope you will consider the matter and provide me with the suitable at earliest.

Thank you and regards
