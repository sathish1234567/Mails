Dear Sir:

I have been offered a job as an IT GS 07 position in Austin, Texas but I prefer to have the same position in Houston, Tx. 
I prefer this IT position in Houston, Texas because this is where my residence and family is located. 
The Houston location assist in with providing help for family members with medical concerns throughout the week and weekends. 
The Houston location will allow to pursue employment and assist family in need of medical issues.
This location is less financial challenging for my family. I thank you in advance for handling this request.

Respectfully yours,
********
