Dear Jane,

I’m writing to request the opportunity to withdraw my resignation dated October 24, 2021. I appreciate your counteroffer and would be delighted to stay on as Account Coordinator at Acme Corp.

I particularly wanted to thank you for taking the time to speak with me last week when I initially resigned. Our conversation really helped clarify for me that I want to continue to build my career at Acme Corp.

Thank you for your support and consideration.

Regards,
