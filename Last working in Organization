Hello All,

Tomorrow is my last day at work here in Jio.

it’s been almost 5.5 great years that I have spent here in Reliance. While I’m excited for the new opportunity ahead of me, leaving Jio and great working relationships like this one is definitely bittersweet.

I am thankful for having this wonderful opportunity to work with you all during the last five years, you all have provided me support through your encouragement and guidance.
With many of you, I have shared a unique camaraderie which I hope will continue in the years to come even though I will not be here with the company.

I would like to thank Mr. @Sampath Manickam @Srinivas Mandavilli @Bipin Khairnar @Abhinav Minda  @Rahul Hiremath @Krishna.Chinthgumpala for guiding me all the time, You are my inspiration yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
Thank you for every role you have played in my professional life! I am indebted to you! :)

Wishing everyone all the best moving forward. And, thanks again for being a part of making my time here at Jio such a great one!

A big thanks to my team
